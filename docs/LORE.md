# The Lore of Nemeths Domain

## THE SLEEPING TITAN

In the age before ages, before the gods shaped the heavens and the mortals crawled from the mud, there was **Nemeth**.

Nemeth was not good. Nemeth was not evil. Nemeth simply *was*.

A Titan of such immense power that their dreams became reality and their nightmares became flesh. When Nemeth walked, continents formed beneath their feet. When Nemeth spoke, languages were born. When Nemeth bled, oceans filled the wounds.

The gods - those jealous children of creation - feared what Nemeth might become if they ever truly *woke*. So they waged war. A thousand divine spears pierced the Titan's flesh. A million prayers bound their limbs. And when the final blow was struck, Nemeth did not die.

**Nemeth fell into slumber.**

The Titan's body crashed through the fabric of reality, shattering a continent into a thousand pieces. Where Nemeth's heart came to rest, the land itself pulses with power. Where their blood pooled, magic runs thick as water. Where their dreams leak into the world, both saints and monsters are born.

Nemeth sleeps still. But even in slumber, the Titan's presence echoes through every mind - a whisper at the edge of thought, a shadow in every ambition. Some hear promises of glory. Others hear warnings of doom. All hear *something*.

**And every 90 days, Nemeth's heart beats once.**

## THE HEARTBEAT

The Titan's heartbeat is not a gentle thing.

When Nemeth's slumbering heart contracts, reality *shudders*. The land remembers its master and rejects all who have claimed it. Kingdoms crumble. Armies scatter. Fortresses sink into the earth. Every banner raised, every wall built, every throne claimed - all of it returns to nothing.

This is not destruction. This is *reset*.

The Heartbeat reminds all who dwell upon the Domain of a simple truth: **You do not own this land. You merely borrow it between the Titan's breaths.**

And yet, mortals return. They always return. Because in those 90 days between Heartbeats, empires can rise. Legends can be forged. And those who prove themselves worthy earn something that even the Heartbeat cannot erase.

## THE SHATTERED CONTINENT

When Nemeth fell, the impact split a great continent into fragments - islands of varying size scattered across a churning sea. This broken land is **The Domain**.

**The Outer Reaches**
The edges of the Domain are the most stable - furthest from Nemeth's heart, least touched by the Titan's dreams. Here, the races establish their footholds when each cycle begins. The land is harsh but predictable. Resources are scarce but reliable.

**The Middle Territories**
Closer to the center, the land grows strange. Magic seeps from the ground. Creatures twisted by Nemeth's nightmares roam the wilds. But the resources are richer, the strategic positions more valuable. Those who would rule must venture here.

**The Inner Ring**
The islands closest to the heart are saturated with Titan-blood. Reality bends. Time stutters. Power beyond mortal understanding awaits those bold enough to claim it - and terrible enough to hold it.

**The Heart**
At the very center of the Domain lies a single island where Nemeth's heart beats beneath the stone. This is **Nemeth's Throne** - not a chair, but a concept. Whoever controls the Heart when the Heartbeat comes does not merely survive the reset.

They are *remembered*.

## WHY THEY FIGHT

Ask a scholar why the races war over the Domain, and they will speak of the Titan's power - the magic that flows from the Heart, the artifacts buried in Nemeth's flesh, the secrets whispered in dreams.

Ask a soldier, and they will speak of duty - to their race, their captain, their beliefs.

Ask a merchant, and they will speak of wealth - the resources that flow from Titan-touched land, the trade routes that connect the islands.

Ask a priest, and they will speak of prophecy - that one day, someone will sit upon Nemeth's Throne when the Titan finally wakes, and that person will either save all of creation or doom it.

**But the truth is simpler.**

They fight because that is what mortals do. For power. For gold. For glory. For revenge. For love. For hate. For reasons they themselves do not fully understand.

Nemeth does not judge. Nemeth does not care. Nemeth only dreams.

And in those dreams, all of them - the righteous and the wicked, the conquerors and the conquered - are equally small.

## THE DOMAIN COUNCIL

Not all is lost when the Heartbeat comes.

At the center of the Domain, untouched by the Titan's pulse, stands an ancient monument older than any living memory. Some say the gods placed it there to record their victory. Others say Nemeth created it in their final waking moment - a witness to remember what the Heartbeat erases.

This is **The Titan's Witness** - and upon its surface, names are carved in light that never fades.

When the Heartbeat comes, those who have proven themselves worthy - who have conquered the most territory, won the most battles, accumulated the most power - find their names etched into the monument's eternal stone. These are the **Domain Council**: champions whose glory survives the reset.

The Council carries no political power. They command no armies between cycles. But their names burn bright for all eternity, visible to every soul who enters the Domain.

In a world where everything is temporary, **they are permanent**.

And in a game where Nemeth erases all achievement every 90 days, that permanence is worth more than any crown.

## THE WHISPER

Every captain who enters the Domain hears it eventually.

A voice at the edge of sleep. A thought that isn't quite their own. A pull toward the center that defies reason.

Some call it Nemeth's will. Others call it madness. A few believe it is a warning - that the Titan stirs more each cycle, that the Heartbeats grow stronger, that one day Nemeth will wake and all of creation will answer for disturbing their slumber.

The truth? No one knows.

But the whisper says the same thing to everyone, whether they serve light or darkness:

*"Come to me. Prove yourself. And when I wake... I will remember your name."*

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

1. **The Monument Name** - What is the eternal record called?
2. **The Races** - Who dwells upon the Domain?
3. **The Classes** - What forms do the captains take?
4. **The Magic** - How does Titan-blood affect spellcraft?
5. **The Prophecy** - What happens when Nemeth wakes?

*"Between heartbeats, empires rise. Between heartbeats, legends fall. Between heartbeats, you have exactly 90 days to etch your name into eternity."*
