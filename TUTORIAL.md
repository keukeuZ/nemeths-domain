## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Getting Started

**Q: What race should I pick?**
A: Each race suits different playstyles:
- **Ironveld** - Defensive, forgiving, good for learning
- **Vaelthir** - High risk/reward magic, for aggressive players
- **Korrath** - Pure aggression, raid early and often
- **Sylvaeth** - Intel-focused, know everything, strike precisely
- **Ashborn** - Attrition warfare, wear enemies down over time
- **Breath-Born** - Disruptive control, frustrate enemy plans

**Q: How do I win?**
A: Earn the most Domain Points by generation end (Day 90). Points come from:
- Holding territory (1 point/plot/day)
- Controlling the Heart (center, +100 points/plot/day)
- Inner Ring bonus (+5/plot/day)
- Middle Ring bonus (+2/plot/day)

**Q: What happens when the generation ends?**
A: Everything resets except:
- Your name on the Titan's Witness (if you qualified)
- Your experience as a player
Next generation, everyone starts fresh with new placement.

**Q: Can I join late?**
A: Yes, until Day 14. After that, registration closes. Late joiners start with bonus resources to catch up.

### Combat

**Q: How does combat work?**
A: Both sides roll weighted D20 dice:
- Roll 8-13 (40% chance): Normal result
- Roll 14-17 (25%): Good result
- Roll 18-19 (10%): Great result
- Roll 20 (5%): Critical success
- Roll 1 (5%): Critical failure
Your army stats modify the roll. Higher total wins.

**Q: Why did I lose that battle?**
A: Check the combat log for:
- Their army composition (counters?)
- Terrain advantage (defender bonus?)
- Captain abilities used
- Spells cast
- Your dice rolls vs theirs

**Q: What are Advantage/Disadvantage?**
A:
- **Advantage**: Roll 2 dice, keep the better one
- **Disadvantage**: Roll 2 dice, keep the worse one
Terrain, abilities, and spells can grant these.

**Q: Do defenders have an advantage?**
A: Yes, +2 to defense rolls. Fortified positions give more.

### Resources

**Q: I'm running out of food!**
A:
- Build more Farms (base production)
- Upgrade to Granary (storage + production)
- Reduce army size (fewer mouths to feed)
- Some races (Ironveld, Ashborn, Breath-Born) don't need food

**Q: What's the most important resource?**
A: Depends on your strategy:
- **Gold** - Universal, needed for everything
- **Food** - Limits army size
- **Stone** - Defensive buildings
- **Wood** - Basic buildings, units
- **Mana** - Spellcasting power

**Q: How do I get more mana?**
A:
- Build Mana Wells
- Vaelthir generate 50% more naturally
- Blood sacrifice (Vaelthir only, costs HP)
- Capture territory with Ley Lines

### Territory

**Q: How do I expand?**
A:
1. Train an army
2. Move to adjacent unclaimed/enemy tile
3. Attack (if enemies present)
4. Claim the tile

**Q: What are the Forsaken?**
A: NPC villages that fill unclaimed territory. They:
- Don't expand or attack
- Defend if attacked
- Provide loot when conquered
- Range from Hamlets (weak) to Strongholds (tough)

**Q: What happens if I go inactive?**
A: Leadership decay:
- Days 1-3: No penalty (grace period)
- Days 4-7: -5% trust per day
- Days 8-14: -10% trust per day
- Days 15+: -15% trust per day
- At 0% trust: Territory revolts, becomes Forsaken

### Alliances

**Q: Should I join an alliance?**
A: Alliances provide:
- Shared vision
- Troop movement through ally territory
- Coordinated attacks
- Diplomatic protection
But also: Shared enemies, obligations, potential betrayal

**Q: Can allies park troops in my territory?**
A: Yes, but it costs:
- **Lodging**: 25-500 gold/day based on unit tier
- **Food**: If they need food and you produce it
- **Foreign Soil Penalty**: Their troops weaken over time (-5% to -35%)
- **AOE Risk**: Grouped armies take +15% to +75% spell damage

**Q: Can allies betray me?**
A: Yes. Alliances can be broken. Trust carefully.

### Captains

**Q: What captain class should I pick?**
A: Depends on your strategy:
- **Warlord** - Direct combat power
- **Archmage** - Magical devastation
- **High Priest** - Healing, buffs, morale
- **Shadow Master** - Assassination, sabotage, intel
- **Merchant Prince** - Economic advantage
- **Beastlord** - Monster units, wilderness control

**Q: What happens if my captain dies?**
A: Captains get death saves (D20 roll):
- 10+: Survive with 1 HP
- 1-9: Dead
Modifiers apply based on situation. Dead captains can be replaced, but lose all progress.

**Q: How do captain skills work?**
A:
- Earn 20 skill points per generation
- Spend on skills in your chosen path
- Skills have prerequisites (tree structure)
- Choose wisely - no respec

### Magic

**Q: How do I cast spells?**
A:
1. Have enough mana
2. Select spell from spellbook
3. Choose target (if applicable)
4. Spell resolves with D20 roll for effect magnitude

**Q: What spell school should I focus on?**
A:
- **Destruction** - Direct damage
- **Protection** - Defense, shields
- **Divination** - Intel, vision
- **Conjuration** - Summon units
- **Enchantment** - Buffs, debuffs
- **Restoration** - Healing, cleansing

**Q: What is blood sacrifice?**
A: Vaelthir-only mechanic:
- Sacrifice unit HP for mana
- More HP = more mana
- Risk: Killed units = no benefit
- Reward: Up to +20% spell power on rare rolls

### Strategy Tips

**Q: What should I do first?**
A:
1. Build Farm + Barracks
2. Train basic army
3. Scout nearby territory
4. Conquer nearest Forsaken Hamlet
5. Build economy before expanding fast

**Q: When should I attack other players?**
A: Consider:
- PvP disabled first 7 days
- Are you stronger? (scout first!)
- Can you hold what you take?
- Will their allies retaliate?
- Is it worth the Domain Points?

**Q: How do I defend against stronger players?**
A:
- Build Watchtowers, Walls, Fortress
- Use terrain (mountains, forests)
- Alliance protection
- Threat of mutual destruction
- Diplomatic negotiation

**Q: What's the best race?**
A: There is no "best" - they're balanced differently:
- Ironveld wins defense
- Vaelthir wins magic burst
- Korrath wins early aggression
- Sylvaeth wins information war
- Ashborn wins long attrition
- Breath-Born wins disruption

**Layer 3: Codex Entry**
Full probability table, all modifiers, examples.

**Layer 4: Combat Log**
